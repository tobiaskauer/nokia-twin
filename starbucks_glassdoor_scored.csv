212,2019-3, Barista,,Former Employee ,Its an experience,"They have great benefits, such as health insurance, 401(K), and Bean stock. Starbucks gives you a certain amount of money for you to invest in stocks or to add it to your 401(K). Being employed at Starbucks give you certain perks such a free drinks and 1 free food for each shift you work. Starbucks also has a more versatile uniform option now, which allows partners to have different colored dyed hair. Also, depending on the people at your store you tend to make a lot of work friends.","Some of the cons at working at Starbucks is the long hours depending what time your store closes. Some stores close as late as 11:00 p.m, while there are some twenty-four hours. Another con is that they do not tell you that if you close you will be cleaning A LOT. One of your responsibilities as a barista is to clean your store before you close, this means you have to sweep, mop, wash dishes, and clean drains. If you are an individual who does not like labor such as this, I highly do not recommend this job.",3.0,,,,,,0.569352924823761,0.5286928415298462,0.4242331385612488,0.5287365317344666,0.4363881051540375,0.3055267930030823,0.4901321530342102,0.5008757710456848,0.6188108325004578,0.38785603642463684,0.9953891038894653,0.020195836201310158,0.04558739438652992,5.736507660003554e-07,0.010521761141717434,0.0009031429653987288,0.0037775770761072636,0.3297708332538605,0.0893094465136528,0.0006085995119065046,0.9953352808952332,0.006355769466608763,0.04625813663005829,5.725555070057453e-07,0.0009025631588883698,0.000168973405379802,0.9969049096107483,0.3871094584465027,0.07648163288831711,0.001069026067852974

I've consistently almost collapsed on shifts before after being refused 5 minutes to drink some water.

My experience has always been okay as I am thick skinned, but you need to be prepared to get some bad customers. Management is another thing the company seems to have an issue with, shifts being changed, rotas being posted last minute and simple management tasks commonly not being done to a high standard.",4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.5081110596656799,0.5393192172050476,0.487261027097702,0.4698009490966797,0.461044043302536,0.5152910351753235,0.49968311190605164,0.48476600646972656,0.6240738034248352,0.4512149691581726,0.9953752756118774,0.0075720008462667465,0.06346738338470459,8.519382390659302e-07,0.0009613704169169068,5.558515840675682e-05,0.9972594976425171,0.40071412920951843,0.2456713616847992,0.0006445428589358926,0.9955071210861206,0.014136056415736675,0.05029727518558502,8.682923180458602e-07,0.0007415221189148724,0.00012769938621204346,0.003914208151400089,0.3872646689414978,0.03984929993748665,0.20776458084583282

The hourly rate is reasonable. Overall, good company to work in. It is convenient that one is able to pick up extra shifts at other stores when one wants to work extra hours. Seasonal work is also available so great for students and people looking for temporary work. Flexible hours.","I still wonder how there are so many competent supervisors who do not get promoted and incompetent managers who seem to not know what they are doing.

Starting as a barista there is good potential to be promoted to a supervisor, as was I.

I was offered a promotion numerous times but my interests are elsewhere - Work-life balance,- Rotas sometimes came out really late. I didn't know my Boxing Day shift until Christmas Eve - If you take a promotion to supervisor you'll get worked to the bone and flexibility in terms of shifts will be impossible. Be aware! - Managers are hit and miss - Staff that have been in the company for years are sensitive to new ideas and different ways of doing things.

There are genuine paths of progression, and because all of your seniors will have worked the role you are close to tears trying to master, they can offer guidance. It's nice to be able to have someone take you aside and advise you on a process that they know you will need. During non-peak times my team mates are really good fun, and there is a lot of stuff to learn that is ten times less stressful than peak-hours. In my store they have been more than accommodating for my shift hour needs. Needless to say this will be on a store by store basis, so I can only talk about my own experience. Free drinks. Need I say any more. You can have 20 drinks or a single drink. It doesn't matter. There are no limits. You also get 50% off food which is more than fair.","Peak hours are crazy and are assuredly not for the faint heart. I am working at Starbucks for the sole purpose of getting good at making drinks in an environment where lines of customers await so that I can branch out and do my own self employed thing. Had I not that light at the end of the tunnel I am not so sure I would continue. You can work other customer service sector jobs that pay more with a whole lot less stress For the levels of stress and workload a store manager has, the pay doesn't compensate enough. so most people have questionable attitudes towards their work (thus their staff). They're not getting paid enough to care, and I have personally found that store managers can really dish out the dirt to lower partners. I recall Gordon Ramsay talking about it once. He had to go through the fire and so anybody beneath him will also have to. Perhaps this is inherent in the food and drink industry. Due to the stress caused during peak rush hours it can really bring the worst out in some people. I have personally been called slow and messy by my store manager in front of my team mates, and other partners have also gotten it in the neck. Is this as a result of stress? More than lightly. You can only do your best, but this happened to me 12 months ago on my second peak shift. I know at the time I felt it was very discouraging and deflated, and I felt that everybody around me thought I was completely useless. Once again it's the situation whereby a store manager has been burnt this way, so they will continue that process. In my particular store, stress levels peak insanely when the store manager goes behind the bar. Partners get nervous because the store manager is very pass-remarkable.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.29054558277130127,0.15533757209777832,0.4519885778427124,0.7552433013916016,0.5601194500923157,0.4832555055618286,0.3605515956878662,0.40840184688568115,0.360164612531662,0.30453935265541077,0.99540776014328,0.9800199270248413,0.03693637251853943,5.72147257571487e-07,0.9432802200317383,0.0003821853606496006,0.9969473481178284,0.301409512758255,0.9991692304611206,0.0009056825656443834,0.9956979751586914,0.010006813332438469,0.05242114141583443,5.708707249141298e-07,0.0006854929961264133,7.098385685821995e-05,0.003910350613296032,0.3456016182899475,0.12499967217445374,0.018966255709528923

They are becoming more and more greedy, the employees(partners) aren't important any mor, all that matters is money money money, sales sales sales...and tha'ts ok...but then they are cutting our hours and asking for the same (or better) results in terms of sales budget. How can you expect to cut hours, have less people on the shop floor and achieve the same results?? Not only, but having less people working means that they have to carry the big load of customers on their shoulders all alone which makes us feel stressed out every single minute of our shifts, being impossible to give a great customer service! They are dropping benefits for the employees and givng less and less hours and people on the shop floor, making every day harder for everyone working. This time they're stretching it too much, squeezing people over their stress limits, forcing them to quit (and this will happen soon! at least in my store half of the staff is unhappy and willing to leave asap and the other half are students who work few hours anyway).

Because it's a global corporation, you also tend to get customers complaining about very minor things because they think it will get them free stuff.

Entered the workplace as shy, nervous and unsure of myself. Left in 2015 with confidence and the ability to communicate and think on my feet. Pay is pretty good particularly for younger people. Hours are okay, my store didn't open late but some do open late into the evening. Shifts go by fairly quick as you are never stood around, always plenty of tasks. Always know your position (eg Till, Bar, Café run) due to the daily rota. No need to keep asking for tasks as you will learn them quickly and be able to get on with your job. Potential to become a supervisor/ store manager fairly quickly.","Dependant very much on your team, if you don't like/ don't get along with your team the job will be miserable.

624,2016-2,,,Current Employee ,Starbucks Experience,"The teams of people you work with are usually all really good - Starbucks definitely encourage a healthy team spirit where every store feels like a family. I've worked in a few different stores as I've moved from home to university and it was really great being able to fit in straight away. Things like Barista championships are also fun for meeting people from surrounding stores for some friendly competition. Coffee Master/Coffee tastings are also great, it's a nice way to chat and learn a bit more about coffee and the people you work with. Bean Stock is great!!","Training: I've seen this in a few stores where it takes a long for baristas to be fully trained on bar - often seen them being stuck on till or cafe with little opportunity to get the experience necessary to deal with being on bar in a busy store. For instance one of the partners in our store will have started nearly two years ago and is still not fully competent on bar, simply because he always gets assigned to till because he's good at upselling. To me upselling is the biggest con of working at starbucks - I understand it is part of the job I agreed to do but I feel that with strabucks cards and origins espresso and whatever food we're meant to be upselling that day - the number of questions I have to ask the customer following all these requirements would be ridiculous, especially if there is a queue. If I feel a customer is interested in a product of course I'll be attentive and helpful in selling that to them, but unless I feel the customer is interested I'm usually wasting their time. Starbucks cards, while I mention it - suck. Everyone thinks they're like a costa points card (which lets be real, they are so much simpler and easier to use) and then when it takes 5 mins to explain you have to put money on the card and then gets the points from each transaction, oh and you have to activate with £5 in store and it takes you a while to get to Gold so really until then it's pretty pointless. Playbook is confusing and it's not very specific on how to manage with larger deployments - everyone seems to have a different take on how to do it, there seems to be a lot more pressure than usual from management (our district manager came in to check we were doing it correctly and then humiliated our store manager when one of the supervisors didn't know exactly what it was) to be doing this and I have no idea why because it's not that groundbreakingly different. Also the system that manages how many hours we get - supervisors are always moaning about it because it doesn't update quickly. Some supervisors can be mean when it comes to scheduling shifts and give you a 5.5 hour shift so you're only entitled to a 10 minute break which I have seen happen in most stores - someone who worked in another store said they were given 5hr45min shifts. This sucks - it's really demoralising and you feel like you're being ripped off - but then we don't get paid for our 30 min lunch breaks anymore either..",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,0.5340770483016968,0.5601266026496887,0.4768499433994293,0.4791155457496643,0.44876226782798767,0.4367132782936096,0.501028299331665,0.4870815575122833,0.41705742478370667,0.4577506184577942,0.9956812858581543,0.04000714048743248,0.10139066725969315,5.937758373875113e-07,0.9865968823432922,0.0001830315450206399,0.9974333643913269,0.18191175162792206,0.9993230104446411,0.0005313835572451353,0.995171844959259,0.009767678566277027,0.09868953377008438,7.848236123209062e-07,0.000844381982460618,2.2053874999983236e-05,0.004091940820217133,0.2403186708688736,0.4673473834991455,0.007269605062901974

639,2016-1, Barista,"London, England",Former Employee ,Truly Awful!- Avoid it like the Plague unless it's your only hope,"Free Drinks, 50% off Food - Their Mulled Grape and Mulled Apple drinks which are really delicious- Also Caramel Macchiato which you can't get anywhere else - Working with some great people - That's about it","I've already posted a review before which can be found amongst the more recent ones but just felt I had a bit more to say so I'll say it. - Huge amounts of pressure on staff to upsell Merchandise offers, different-tasting coffee, and to persuade customers into getting the Starbucks Mobile Application but with completely no incentive or reward whatsoever. Most of them are not even interested and are able to detect immediately that you are trying to sell them something they didn't even want in the first place. This means you have to ask every customer 5 questions when all they want is their coffee. It's annoying for both them and us and the company's expectations are completely ridiculous given the low pay, poor working hours and often unsafe working conditions. Naturally, of course, they are thinking merely to their own profit while it's us Baristas who have to deal with the consequences of it all. - Unpaid breaks - I heard this has been the case since 2013 and it's frankly disgusting. Not only do employees only get half an hour anyway, but we have to put up and deal with a lot in the way of overly demanding customers and understaffed stores - A paid break is the least we should get! - Dishonest marketing - Yes, I said it, Starbucks marketing tactics are not just manipulative (which fair enough most marketing tactics are), but also just outright dishonest. An example would be that over Christmas they sent an email to MSR registered customers telling them they could get a free item from the pastry case - in reality they were only allowed certain items (the less expensive ones, of course), but in the email there was nothing about this! I witnessed several other such examples during the course of my time there and it's unacceptable. - Terrible pay for Managers -Starbucks managers have to put up with enormous amounts of stress, and hassle, and responsibility, and yet from what I know their pay is something like 26k a year. Again managers are not incentivized whatsoever as their store could be the top in the country sales-wise and yet they don't even get 1% of it. This combined with the pressure means lots of frustration for them which also trickles down to Baristas who get the worst of it. - Burnt Espresso - With all the money, reputation, and resources it has, you would think Starbucks is at least good at one thing- making coffee - but no, because Starbucks heat their coffee at such a high temperature it often comes out with a burnt taste, and several people have commented on this. This fact, along with how vastly overpriced most of their drinks are, means I would never go there as a customer. As I said in the title, unless you are really pushed for money find something better - My experience working there was improved a bit by the fact that my first manager was really nice most of the time and like I said I worked with some really cool people - Also the store is really near to me which helped - However, this doesn't change my opinion of S-bucks as a company, which is of course extremely low.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.38608938455581665,0.03040383942425251,0.24894168972969055,1.397927576363145e-06,0.35898175835609436,0.003136896062642336,0.30533960461616516,0.37275055050849915,0.5347453355789185,0.5104668736457825,0.9858931303024292,0.02332114987075329,0.09598151594400406,8.044257242545427e-07,0.006549634970724583,0.010473898611962795,0.008272337727248669,0.43908244371414185,0.5772148966789246,0.019618656486272812,0.9951802492141724,0.9699861407279968,0.051295582205057144,8.488621006108588e-07,0.000867763883434236,0.0031957519240677357,0.9972182512283325,0.3596728444099426,0.999051034450531,0.020999502390623093

I have yet to be fully trained, rather then them train me properly, they pass me along to other baristas that have no patience and expect you to know everything, supervisors don't do anything buy give orders so they avoid helping you out. they also have favouritism so they only give certain individuals recognition. I've never felt so low in all my employability experience. they even ask you out of everyone to clean toilets, bin runs, busking just because you are new. And the store is so busy that training is impossible. The hours are hideous and when you are new they will put you in for a lot of weekends because of course they need a cleaner for the whole weekend.

She doesn't know how to work as part of a team because when everything is great it's fine, but when everything is wrong she says you are alone. you don't have a work life balance because your rota often is horrible and you are off when your friends are working.

We all had the same standard of work, but miraculously when it came time to promote to supervisor, all the spanish women were selected. The assistant manager was spanish. I am sure that was just a coincidence. 2. We were compelled to empty the womens sanitary towel containers. I was sure that was niether legal nor hygienic and that they are usually removed by rentokil etc and incinerated. 3 I remember another occasion where a sewage pipe exploded and flooded the ground floor in human excrement. I was asked to clean it up. It is difficult to refuse when you need your job, and I was younger then and not as able to stand up for myself. It subsequently flooded again and I don't remember if I had to mop it again but I think I did. The carpet was subsequently replaced.

755,2014-7, Barista,,Former Employee ,Great company if you can handle it,"The benefits are out of sight. I was offered Starbucks stock after my first year, as well as 401k through Fidelity, and a superb Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules). There's also an Employee Assistance Hotline which you can call if you're having issues in your personal life. And HR is really responsive--they won't see you as a troublemaker if you're legitimately having an issue. They will handle it. Also, sexual orientation and gender identity are included in their anti-discrimination policy. None of the gay or lesbian people on my staff got crap for it, even though about half the staff was quietly conservative Christian and Republican. If you're a people person, you develop relationships with the regulars and it's fun to make their day. I felt it was pretty rewarding to make drinks. I loved the artistic side of it. And again, the free coffee...just awesome. They're also usually pretty flexible about scheduling, so it's ideal for if you're working two jobs or are a student. I worked with people in their 50's who had their own careers, but worked part-time at Starbucks for the health insurance. The vacation time system is also pretty sweet. I worked with a guy who was there for 10 years and took like a month vacation to his home country. The staffs can be really tight...or they can be really vicious. But a spirit of teamwork is definitely encouraged. And exemplary work is recognized. In an 8-hour shift you get three breaks: one 30-minute clock-out lunch, and two 10-minute on the clock breaks. You'll also occasionally get those amazing customers and you live for seeing them. We had four customers who every year each put 100 bucks in our tip jar around Christmas. Sometimes those people can make your day with the things they say and do.","If you work at a store worth their salt they will work you to the bone. Especially in a large or high-volume store there is so much to do, so much to clean. A morning shift person will have the absolutely insanity of a morning rush, but an evening person should be expected to handle evening rushes with a limited staff as WELL as get the place spotless in what I believe is not a reasonable time. We could get the place clean by 10:45, all right--if we broke the health and corporate rules about when to tear things down. And of course if that was ever found out we were in deep. And if we went over 10:45 we were also in trouble. Management sometimes has some very unrealistic ideas about what the job actually entails and what rules and boundaries should go with that. The pay in my state starts near minimum wage. The ceiling for a barista is $10/hr, which you hit when you've been there about five years. But tips help, and some high-volume affluent stores will have tips up to $4/hr. There's also a tendency to have fanatical management. Other ""kindly"" corporations like Whole Foods have this too--the managers drink the Kool-Aid and worship the company. I once spoke with my manager because my schedule was being changed with less than 24 hours notice, and that was against state law. She got this crazed look in her eye and spat ""Starbucks law goes above state law!"" But that's only a tendency. There are some pretty cool managers out there. Mine was insane. The customers are spoiled rotten so they also get kind of unreasonable about their Starbucks. They will stand there and demand that you make a drink five times because there's still foam on that latte and they said NO foam, not LIGHT foam. This is a business model of Starbucks': everyone is special, and we will bend the rules for everybody. And I've had people scream at me and call me a (b) and promise me that they would make me lose my job. I've also had stuff thrown at me. But, that's also just customer service. These last few years Starbucks has been obsessed with selling, too. There's a lot of pressure on the staff to make sure people go home with $15 bags of coffee and sub-par espresso machines. It's hard to maintain the relationships they want us to maintain while trying to sell stuff. Overall, if you can put up with the customers and the physical demand, and if benefits are more important than income, do it. It's rewarding in its own way.

Benefits are unbeatable and constantly evolving to meet the needs of the workforce. Opportunities abound for development and career advancement. You must be a self-starter and apply yourself.

This is more than I can say of many retail companies I've worked for in the past. We are empowered to make decisions and take action to make our stores the best they can be.

There is not enough supervision on store managers and not enough support from district managers. There was a real delay between what happened on the west coast and what made it to the east coast. I've heard west coast Starbucks is like an entirely different business. Very little opportunity for development or growth outside promoting directly up the ladder. If your shop has enough shift managers, you're not likely to see an opportunity for development. Because of this, talented staff end up leaving to better and less stressful jobs, and the folks who get promoted are mediocre or downright amoral. Exhausting. Especially if you are a full-time student. They will overwork you, whether you say yes or no. It is an absolutely thankless job. People who poured their hearts and souls into the business were never appreciated by higher-ups, and could even be seen as trouble makers for trying to develop their staff. Customers at Starbucks are the worst customers I've encountered in my career. I don't know what it is about Starbucks that makes people the worst versions of themselves, but they truly are.",2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.4609319269657135,0.4109981954097748,0.4619007408618927,0.5586198568344116,0.5008745193481445,0.00945401843637228,0.4148694574832916,0.3986811637878418,0.46698570251464844,0.42551228404045105,0.9689254760742188,0.15394769608974457,0.26727238297462463,8.608847110735951e-07,0.9031548500061035,0.023535175248980522,0.008828015998005867,0.3028111457824707,0.43585729598999023,0.002630496397614479,0.9953404664993286,0.006489699240773916,0.04196463152766228,5.687405746357399e-07,0.0008044871501624584,0.0001815769646782428,0.9971501231193542,0.516250491142273,0.060040175914764404,0.9292766451835632

Pretty much we’re always cleaning , mopping the floors and cleaning the bathroom feels humiliating and sad at times. They need to hire separate cleaners for their deep clean shifts and for the bathrooms perhaps cafe floors as well. For minimum wage you shouldn’t have all of these responsibilities sorry. Its not human and you feel like you have to be a robot working here more than anywhere else due to the greater responsibility and duties here you have no room to just let go of your stress. Very stressful, when it gets busy you will feel overwhelmed and panicky because it feels like there’s no room to make any errors , not a good job for sensitive people or for those who cannot handle fast pace Minimum wage jobs feel life sucking but they expect a lot out of you here, like connections with customers, and an energy that is beyond their pay. All in all , you’ll be exhausted and most likely depressed.

1100,2020-1, Barista ,,Current Employee ,Best Job,"Regular customers that become friends and coworkers that become family. The Starbucks way is something incredible to be a part of. IEven when it’s crazy busy, you know your coworkers will have your back. Rushes can be fun, it definitely takes your mind off whatever else you may be dealing with, because all you have time to think of are the drinks you’re making. Pushing through a busy shift is rewarding. Closing the store is a lot of work, but super fun. The community is so supportive and the corporation gives back to its loyal workers. Being a partner can include free Spotify Premium &amp; Headspace. Starbucks has some of the best insurance for its workers. One could even get a full tuition scholarship for ASU online as long as you put in 20 hours a week at the bux.","Sometimes you could get screwed by having bad management. You must be fast when making drinks and have a sense of urgency because things get crazy (especially November - January. You can’t just be coasting during a happy hour. And if you work a Saturday or Sunday morning during the summer/holiday season, god bless ur soul, big rip. Keen on customer service, especially during stressful times. Being understaffed , and during the holiday seasons when the managers are cutting hours to get their bonuses is super frustrating.

It's very physicall demanding, I find it takes a toll on my body during 8 hour shifts (which are very tiring compared to doing 8 hour shifts at some other job).

1136,2020-1, Barista,,Former Employee ,"Great upper managment support, but in store managers will really effect your experience.",-Starbucks encourages good engagement and long term relationship building especially with regulars. -Tips on top of an hourly rate that starts above minimum wage. -Starbucks is constantly trying to improve its work flow and encourages employees to switch positions often to avoid repetitive stress injuries and just the general burn out of working the same station to frequently.,-A good or bad manager will make all the difference. -There needs to be more stress on management to not over schedule individuals. I was once scheduled for 7 days in a row with them split between two work weeks so I didn't get any overtime. -Some of the drinks are overly complicated to make and made it difficult to keep up with the orders. -Not sure if this was store management decision or a corporate one but we were understaffed and told we couldn't get any more store hours until we boosted our sales. At the time we would do 82 orders every half hour during our peak and would stay steady until late afternoon. -I was hired as a full time employee and a new manager decided all Baristas would be part time and I had my hours severely cut and led me to seek out other employment.,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,0.8383689522743225,0.7393028736114502,0.29551076889038086,0.8231751918792725,0.44914475083351135,0.0001313370157731697,0.5715524554252625,0.46297505497932434,0.15429900586605072,0.01386223267763853,0.9955015778541565,0.9720069766044617,0.04426624998450279,5.725577238990809e-07,0.40886029601097107,0.00010537268099142238,0.003885098500177264,0.27265703678131104,0.07548637688159943,0.28712037205696106,0.9952473044395447,0.026231124997138977,0.04918471351265907,8.542512546227954e-07,0.0009074027184396982,0.0003807363682426512,0.004066314548254013,0.17724153399467468,0.02344619296491146,0.0018963649636134505

The customer base is been on many cases, abusive to me and the partners. I've had to develop a VERY thick skin. I have to call the police every two days and the area I work at isn't even that bad. This has been the case for two other locations I've worked at. I've had to identify so many people, make many reports with tip theft. I've found guns. plural. In the restroom. I've been threatened and cursed at all the time by customers. I've had managers schedule me so poorly that I lost my insurance, this happened twice. I also lost my insurance with a confirmed transfer to another store. He got in an argument with my current manager without my knowledge. So i had 2-3 weeks of unscheduled shifts where I had to arrange my hours with other stores myself. The job really depends on which management you get.

You learn how to work in a team and slowly learn leadership because its a company that is always hiring and new hires always ask people with seniority for help.,"There are cliques and the system is corrupt in a sense that corporate does nothing to stop harassment and all that training does not enforce employees to stop bullying. I had a bittersweet experience being a barista. I loved working with customers but I had the toughest time with my fellow coworkers. Its like high school all over again and the new guy is the loser and no one cares and the boss partakes in the bullying because they are also immature and only care about being liked. My boss was a bully and she and the shifts would gas light all the baristas they didn't like because they were ""different."" Also a lot of racism. My boss was always so nice to white homeless people yet if a black homeless person came in she would not serve them and ask them to leave even if they just wanted hot water because its cold outside.

District managers appear to win their positions with their talk and bravado, but when they are with their store managers, their incompetency shows. The company likes to say ""treat it as if it were your own business"", and then they proceed to micro-manage every detail. ""Administrative duties"" are many, yet there is virtually no time allowed for their completion, so these are typically done on your own time. When the company introduces a product that bombs, they will blame store managers for the failure, even though the failure was across the whole business. They gaslight managers into believing it was their own ineptitude that resulted in the product failure.",2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.5718026757240295,0.4616136848926544,0.38612791895866394,0.4288860857486725,0.34978488087654114,0.033429183065891266,0.4518081545829773,0.4350724220275879,0.5448798537254333,0.44905996322631836,0.6080861687660217,0.3292456567287445,0.48485779762268066,0.7089428901672363,0.5893868207931519,0.0010378110455349088,0.6585647463798523,0.44884559512138367,0.6436462998390198,0.031550560146570206,0.9953480362892151,0.9661667943000793,0.04344472661614418,5.710994628316257e-07,0.0007179992971941829,2.9192313377279788e-05,0.004408767446875572,0.38840100169181824,0.07960101962089539,0.9461475014686584

The ability to get part-time benefits, 5% matching 401K contributions, stock options, and tuition reimbursements make working for Starbucks something awesome. Not to mention that you get free drinks and a food markout during your shift, once a week coffee mark-outs, and Tax deductible Spotify premium.","- Pay: The fact of the matter is you are not going to make enough money to support any form of decent living unless you are an Assistant Manager or above. - Promotion from within: Becoming a manager from within is almost always a uphill battle as the competition is steep and always a popularity contest with your district manager. It is probably easier to become a manager at a different company and then become an external hire. Culture change: The face of the matter is, Starbucks is changing, CONNECTION CONNECTION CONNECTION. You have to try to connect with everybody and that is just the way it is. People can be amazing or awful just like in any other food hospitality/fast food business but some of the expectations from customers is kind of crazy sometimes.",4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,0.5780150294303894,0.5375082492828369,0.617825984954834,0.5638481378555298,0.4057534337043762,0.035476721823215485,0.5354300737380981,0.46535933017730713,0.3934026062488556,0.15149571001529694,0.9953973889350891,0.3244278132915497,0.07736781239509583,5.718690090361633e-07,0.9836881160736084,9.30773894651793e-05,0.0038863830268383026,0.318698912858963,0.021279938519001007,0.0018931049853563309,0.9955077171325684,0.9732475876808167,0.0455220565199852,8.515564786648611e-07,0.0007246900349855423,7.841792103135958e-05,0.003938958514481783,0.32204827666282654,0.6767269968986511,0.023680545389652252

1499,2019-12, Shift Supervisor,"Boston, MA",Former Employee ,Store environments range from amazing to awful,"Starbucks offers a lot of benefits to even part-time employees. This includes little perks such as free drinks throughout any shift, a free food item per day, and a free pound of coffee per week. Depending on the store and manager, you can find yourself in an environment that consistently and strongly advocates for its employees and goes out of their way to ensure your well-being even outside of work. The company also offers a variety of opportunities that can lead to a wide variety of experiences, such as traveling to Washington to tour a roastery, or traveling to another country to tour a coffee plantation.","Starbucks is a persistently stressful environment. It often feels like the company has conflicting priorities, and you'll find yourself being pressured to improve, say, costumer experiences, and as soon as you hit that goal you'll start being pressured to improve store cleanliness, etc. For a company that strives to focus on their employee experience, there is a startling amount of oversight on how the company's decisions and conflicting priorities impact the lowest level employees. Also, promotional drinks that have twenty different steps to make may sound like a trivial issue, but I assure you, it is not fun when there's a line out the door of customers wanting to try a seasonal drink that is not easy to make.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.6987332105636597,0.33472421765327454,0.4380812644958496,0.45367535948753357,0.37069451808929443,0.13638468086719513,0.5363868474960327,0.42892763018608093,0.680566132068634,0.15935325622558594,0.9950740933418274,0.16808147728443146,0.058929845690727234,8.477910000692646e-07,0.0008704055217094719,0.03225299343466759,0.003920737188309431,0.35621342062950134,0.05341087654232979,0.0012741703540086746,0.9957524538040161,0.024838831275701523,0.0349859818816185,5.720954163734859e-07,0.0008113883668556809,0.0003520935424603522,0.003752360586076975,0.28858646750450134,0.9989272952079773,0.3149477541446686

I was voted “Partner of the Quarter” and I have not even been there a year yet. This means my coworkers voted for me because I go above and beyond the call of duty and I work hard giving 100 percent everyday. They also allow me to donate the recently expired discarded food to a local shelter. I go two to three times a week and it leaves me feeling like I can pay it forward.,I have worked at other stores and have seen that any company chain can have well-run stores and inefficient ones as well. There is also a lot of weight put on the head Shift Lead that runs the store. Mine has learned through trial and error how to run a well-oiled machine. We are the busiest store in town so there is no time to hover over small stuff. He coaches rather than corrects. He also leads by example.

1648,2019-12,,,Current Employee ,Good experience but no work / life balance,Pay was good. Benefits were good.,"There is absolutely zero work life balance for store managers. You’re expected to be on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If a shift manager can’t work because they’re sick and you can’t find coverage, you’re expected to work the shift even if that means you have to stay from open until close or close and then have to open less than 5 hours later. In addition, they make it too difficult to fire poor employees. In recent months managers are being micromanaged and every decision needs to be approved by your district manager. They claim that you have autonomy to run your own business but the reality is that is no longer the case. Starbucks is saving hundreds of millions of dollars with all the tax incentives and while they’ve improved some benefits, they’re doing so by cutting labor, not by spending their tax savings. Corporate managers make tens of millions of dollars but expect retail employees who are the bread and butter of Starbucks to live off crumbs.

1668,2019-12, Barista,"Camp Hill, PA",Former Employee ,One of the worst. Don't do it.,"- The benefits are not something to laugh about. You get benefits even for part-time which usually draws in prospective people, so even they have a catch. - You get a free drink before, during and after your shift and one free food item along with a discount when you are not at work. - My coworkers were pretty cool and chill people to talk to in my downtime. - You do get tips weekly and mine would range from $10 to about $25 in a week. - I felt the dress code was pretty lax. They have requirements, but you don't have to wear one, specific shirt or anything. Plus, you can wear beanies to work which for me, was a big plus.","- This job is incredibly fast paced and incredibly stressful. I felt it was not worth the $10 an hour I got and my mental health declined because of it. - My store was incredibly understaffed at almost all times, so we were running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. - There are so many drink modifications it is incredibly hard to keep up. Starbucks also likes to run Happy Hour promotions on Thursdays which also adds more stress to its workers because we usually have double, or even triple, the amount of customers we get in a single day. - In my particular store, I would be on one position at the start of my shift and have gotten moved around 3 to 4 times to do something else. I feel if they want to stick someone somewhere they should leave them there for the day. - Like all customer service jobs, the customers can be downright rude. They are particularly impatient as well if your store has a drive-thru. - You only get paid biweekly, so if this is your only job, you might have to stretch your dollars. - The benefits have a catch to them such as the ""free"" Spotify which comes out of your paycheck and with the college program, they would only compensate you at the end of the semester. - If you are a closer (like I was), you'll be racing to get everything done and everything cleaned in the little time you have as well as attending to customers that come in.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5005353093147278,0.3456944525241852,0.13516663014888763,0.38132160902023315,0.3698243796825409,0.0006647459231317043,0.33046144247055054,0.5259249806404114,0.13893282413482666,0.7885818481445312,0.9954374432563782,0.021770160645246506,0.03977300971746445,5.716928512811137e-07,0.000806669529993087,0.0017016157507896423,0.0038729289080947638,0.21655365824699402,0.9993077516555786,0.000736936111934483,0.9953562617301941,0.009226925671100616,0.04226052761077881,5.710678578907391e-07,0.0009105725912377238,0.0001047792102326639,0.004219064489006996,0.1777968555688858,0.9991772770881653,0.0006900822627358139

You are on call 24/7. I would have stayed another 10 yrs if not for this. Expect to be addicted to checking and in fear of your phone at all times. If any of your keyholders call out- you are working their shift. Expect calls at 3am, 11pm.... even if you have great staffing and a really solid team, you will be contacted by your team for help find product (tons of distribution issues that are unavoidable) or barista coverage (its food service so employees can’t work sick) your DM and other managers constantly either for staffing coverage or company updates. The attitude is, it’s your store, you own it and you’re salary. You will work from home every day, because that’s the only place you can get anything done. As a manager you are still expected to be on the floor in an actual position about 25-30 hrs per week. Yes that means you will be on the bar, cleaning floors, trash runs, putting away huge orders etc. It is an extremely physical job, carpel tunnel and tendinitis are very common in those who have been there for some time. The other 10-15 hrs a week that you have to actually manage the business you will be constantly interrupted and needed on the floor because Starbucks refuses to appropriately staff stores with enough labor hours. The company truly cares about the partners but the expectations are so so so unrealistic. Every few years the company cycles thru focuses on beverage quality, speed, and customer connection. Every time it’s portrayed as something new and what’s needed to save the company, but the amount of kool-aid drinking required...it’s simply un-doable. If you express doubts in any form you are labeled as “not opting in.” You are expected to tie your entire life’s purpose into your role at Starbucks and create vision statements and constantly speak about how fulfilled you are- this is not a joke. If you don’t you aren’t a believer. Once you master one expectation, don’t worry the focus has shifted and none of your previous work matters. If you are somehow able to keep your head above water and master some of this work, you will most likely still not receive a raise because you aren’t “impacting the company outside your four walls” or “going above and beyond.” You do not receive additional compensation for being at a busier store, and it actually makes it harder to bonus since it’s based off comp sales to prior year %. If you do choose to do this, if you’re at a store that’s about 25-30k a week or slower it probably will be doable.",2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.46864476799964905,0.42887312173843384,0.602266252040863,0.48623839020729065,0.46167612075805664,0.02254978008568287,0.4991690516471863,0.4845850467681885,0.39514175057411194,0.3091568350791931,0.9897401332855225,0.4726570248603821,0.07877614349126816,8.45103670599201e-07,0.1893799602985382,0.009460334666073322,0.007872229442000389,0.23270480334758759,0.4043901860713959,0.0018800426041707397,0.9954172372817993,0.08373208343982697,0.03830963000655174,8.243271167884814e-07,0.0009382532443851233,0.00291465618647635,0.004149205982685089,0.23323747515678406,0.15326954424381256,0.0012581413611769676

The job itself is fast paced and stressful. Because of this we have a high turnover rate. We are paid minimum wage, and I haven't gotten any raises to my hourly pay even after being there for 2 years and training several partners. The bonus for training someone is $65, which isn't great considering it takes 2 weeks of my own personal energy into preparing someone the best I can. I think the main thing that makes it worth it is the college achievement plan.

Pay is low compared to other companies - even smaller companies. The food side of sourcing here is a nightmare!

Old school mentality and being spoken down to is the norm in this group.

1873,2019-11, Supervisor,"Toronto, ON",Current Employee ,"Great for Baristas, Horrible If You're Management","You meet some amazing people working here, and the things you learn from every aspect of the job are very useful in ones personal development. The benefits are so great! Great opportunity to learn how to work as a team. The training is thorough and inspiring. This can be such a fun environment and many people have been able to find close friends here. The environment has the ability to be positive and when nurtured, fosters a great, safe place for partners to work. This company seeks to be an inspiration to its community which is such an honourable endeavor. Wonderful loyal customers. Opportunities to move up in the company.","Head office is sloppy at rolling out new ways to run things, with no regard to how much these things will affect all employees, and even customers. Very quick to change things, with little time for implementation. Often, changes have gaps in the information that are sent along with them, and many questions are in need of answering unfortunately. Many stores have special factors that negatively or positively influence the outcome of said changes in the business, and it seems these are often overlooked/ not considered, so the lack of detailed information is very frustrating for everyone from management to baristas. Not highlighting need-to-know information is a MAJOR issue. Information is scattered and extremely unorganized. Awful reputation for hiring incompetent managers who are also rude and condescending to partners. Many of us have found this to be painfully true from location to location, and it's quite unfortunate. The expectation on supervisors and management has a list a mile long, it builds and grows every year, making the job unrealistic and somewhat dehumanizing at times. Many a manager brings their work home to finish, because they have not been allotted enough time at work to complete all they need to do for the team. The amount of time that managers are given to complete their work is pittance. This gets increasingly frustrating when a store is already understaffed and hard pressed for labour (which happens VERY often), so managers are often trying to juggle admin needs while still working on the floor with customers as well. Supervisors are often left to struggle with bad cases of being understaffed in many locations, so the job experience becomes disheartening and draining after a while, and yet they are questioned when they don't seem inspired or over-the-top happy. Baristas are often fed a lot of negativity from upper management. Unprofessional displays of anger from higher ups often get relayed to partners and the result is a very quick lapse in morale. This happens more then it should.",3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.4436626434326172,0.33625859022140503,0.527512788772583,0.5570686459541321,0.4449023902416229,0.005964211188256741,0.3936227858066559,0.4559353291988373,0.3772137463092804,0.5061245560646057,0.9951449036598206,0.10507668554782867,0.9649109840393066,5.7299138234157e-07,0.9824327230453491,0.0013825275236740708,0.997032642364502,0.23455160856246948,0.998870313167572,0.0005950439372099936,0.9953821301460266,0.017905820161104202,0.03468511253595352,8.009350835891382e-07,0.0008579260320402682,0.001031832885928452,0.004073088523000479,0.38296037912368774,0.17756487429141998,0.9001170992851257

1879,2019-11, Supervisor,"Toronto, ON",Current Employee ,"Great for Baristas, Horrible If You're Management","You meet some amazing people working here, and the things you learn from every aspect of the job are very useful in ones personal development. The benefits are so great! Great opportunity to learn how to work as a team. The training is thorough and inspiring. This can be such a fun environment and many people have been able to find close friends here. The environment has the ability to be positive and when nurtured, fosters a great, safe place for partners to work. This company seeks to be an inspiration to its community which is such an honourable endeavor. Wonderful loyal customers. Opportunities to move up in the company.","Head office is sloppy at rolling out new ways to run things, with no regard to how much these things will affect all employees, and even customers. Very quick to change things, with little time for implementation. Often, changes have gaps in the information that are sent along with them, and many questions are in need of answering unfortunately. Many stores have special factors that negatively or positively influence the outcome of said changes in the business, and it seems these are often overlooked/ not considered, so the lack of detailed information is very frustrating for everyone from management to baristas. Not highlighting need-to-know information is a MAJOR issue. Information is scattered and extremely unorganized. Awful reputation for hiring incompetent managers who are also rude and condescending to partners. Many of us have found this to be painfully true from location to location, and it's quite unfortunate. The expectation on supervisors and management has a list a mile long, it builds and grows every year, making the job unrealistic and somewhat dehumanizing at times. Many a manager brings their work home to finish, because they have not been allotted enough time at work to complete all they need to do for the team. The amount of time that managers are given to complete their work is pittance. This gets increasingly frustrating when a store is already understaffed and hard pressed for labour (which happens VERY often), so managers are often trying to juggle admin needs while still working on the floor with customers as well. Supervisors are often left to struggle with bad cases of being understaffed in many locations, so the job experience becomes disheartening and draining after a while, and yet they are questioned when they don't seem inspired or over-the-top happy. Baristas are often fed a lot of negativity from upper management. Unprofessional displays of anger from higher ups often get relayed to partners and the result is a very quick lapse in morale. This happens more then it should.",3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.4436626434326172,0.33625859022140503,0.527512788772583,0.5570686459541321,0.4449023902416229,0.005964211188256741,0.3936227858066559,0.4559353291988373,0.3772137463092804,0.5061245560646057,0.9951449036598206,0.10507668554782867,0.9649109840393066,5.7299138234157e-07,0.9824327230453491,0.0013825275236740708,0.997032642364502,0.23455160856246948,0.998870313167572,0.0005950439372099936,0.9953821301460266,0.017905820161104202,0.03468511253595352,8.009350835891382e-07,0.0008579260320402682,0.001031832885928452,0.004073088523000479,0.38296037912368774,0.17756487429141998,0.9001170992851257

1979,2019-11, Barista,,Former Employee ,insensitive supervisor; I was unfairly treated,Fine part-time job; good location,"I worked at a Starbucks in Frisco, Texas for a couple months. My supervisor and the shift leads would constantly talk bad about me when I wasn’t there, about my “lack of customer connection” and whatever other bad qualities they could snatch out of thin air. I am a kind, bright person (Everyone who actually knows me knows this is true) and would always interact in some way with customers. I was a bit shy at first, but eventually I got better. Nevertheless, My supervisor and shift leads would constantly get me in trouble if they caught me not smiling for a single moment, and tell me to go above and beyond in areas that they themselves were NOT even doing!!! I was one of two black employees working there - I don’t doubt the possibility that they were simply mistreating and misrepresenting my skills simply because I am black. Not only that, my supervisor was not sensitive to my schedule - I work another job in the ER and even though she knew my schedule there, she would constantly try to schedule me on days that I was not available.

When you calculate your pay versus the health insurance price, (depending on if you're part-time or full-time) in some cases you may be working just to pay for the insurance. While Starbucks is great at accommodating their customers and ensuring they receive the correct drink, the barista's receive unpleasant responses from management if they have to remake it.

2016,2019-11, Barista,"Miami, FL",Current Employee ,Wages Stagnate at Poverty Level for all Retail Store employees,"Benefits: Health insurance, a 401K, a part time schedule is available, there is a some sense of teamwork and comraderie in some stores with better managers.","Wages are so consistently low in Florida (9.00 an hour) that there is nothing to put in the 401K Starbucks offers. Not for people who need to financially support others or even themselves. May be a great idea for a high school student or college student, or a retired senior. During the holiday season, starbucks does most of it's coffee sales. The customer count doubles or triples and management does not compensate for this. In September of each year, they cut back employee hours significantly, then will increase them as they need workers during Christmas season. They do not compensate employees monetarily for their work. Baristas typically work very hard and are extremely busy and do not see pay raises. I knew staff who had been there for five years or more and had not gotten pay raises beyond 5 cents or 10 cents a YEAR. The senior and district managers are ""company""managers - meaning they are fairly oblivious on a daily basis to the intense work their retail employees perform. They are all about how your uniform looks and whether your shoes are the right color which is in many ways absurd given the hourly and the number of customers the baristas handle on a daily basis.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.7074154019355774,0.7458217740058899,0.34618884325027466,0.00038468281854875386,0.2758330702781677,0.001502233324572444,0.4824396073818207,0.41908860206604004,0.45515891909599304,0.6946046352386475,0.9914030432701111,0.032950229942798615,0.07313444465398788,0.4252476990222931,0.3957720100879669,0.0004037557228002697,0.004505496006458998,0.52646803855896,0.0942576676607132,0.029161352664232254,0.9954445362091064,0.9792634844779968,0.05176455155014992,8.357240517398168e-07,0.000774790532886982,0.00011429379810579121,0.00397210568189621,0.38793709874153137,0.08098288625478745,0.12583334743976593

2031,2019-10,,,Former Employee ,A Good Learning Experience,"Working at Starbucks gave me a lot of experience working with the general public, something far outside my wheelhouse, so to speak. I gained experience working in one of those ""fast-paced environments"" that I hate, learned how to craft espresso beverages, which I loved, and I increased my stamina and strength by standing for 8 hours a day. It was a fairly tough job, but I grew as an individual. I made great friends among my co-workers and generally Starbucks is good about meeting your scheduling demands. For the most part, I received the hours I requested. Starbucks is generally a very accepting environment, no matter who you are, and that makes for a more comfortable work environment.","Working at Starbucks can be very exhausting. Standing on your feet for 8 hours hurts and if you're like me, interacting with a lot of people can be draining. I often felt totally drained after a shift. I think this job best suits people who are more extroverted. Another downside is the management. Some stores have great managers who get along well with employees, but other stores have managers that create discouraging work environments and don't know how to interact well with their employees. And another con is the fact that Starbucks is giant corporation, so it's easy to feel insignificant as one of a million baristas within a worldwide company.",3.0,,,,,,0.5373780727386475,0.4621334671974182,0.5367475748062134,0.3496946096420288,0.5191794633865356,0.20603018999099731,0.5078067183494568,0.44414642453193665,0.7061687111854553,0.29055437445640564,0.995349109172821,0.0370924286544323,0.052541982382535934,5.721275897485611e-07,0.0009750656899996102,0.0062353177927434444,0.9971363544464111,0.34042420983314514,0.039506349712610245,0.0007311695371754467,0.9954203963279724,0.025887295603752136,0.05362089350819588,8.376063647119736e-07,0.002505408599972725,0.00010959674546029419,0.003998980857431889,0.5111027359962463,0.021504012867808342,0.001753896358422935

2046,2019-10,,"Glen Ridge, NJ",Former Employee ,It was the best of times and the worst of times...,"The free beverages were amazing to the point where I began to hate them. I was spoiled by all of the access we had to those sweet, sweet treasured ingredients! It was so much fun daydreaming about all of the new and tasty combinations I would try out during my upcoming break or lunchbreak! I really enjoyed the majority of the coworkers I had the opportunity to work with and while initially I felt like I was fighting to join into a very tight clique of people who gave off the impression that they didn't need any new friends, I soon wore them down and out and I was accepted into the fold. Going through a multitude of traumatic rush hour experiences with the same group of people day in and day out creates a special type of relationship amongst ones' coworkers. When you're working with a group of people who are both fun and also focused on getting their particular tasks done you find yourself really enjoying your work day. In hindsight I recognize that alot of the friendships that are created at Starbucks are formed through ""trauma bonds"" basically. Read from that what you will. Your favorite customers coming into the store and brightening your day are awesome. I don't know about other locations but my store seemed to be super gay friendly which was amazing because it was the first work environment where I was able to actually be me! That is so important and I didn't even know that it would be such a rare occurrence.","Not much room for advancement at my store. There was a certain group of people who unspokenly were designated to be the potential future leaders of the store. The odd thing is that those future leaders (who also held Shift Leader positions) all just so happened to be of the same race. It was a QUITE noticeable matter of fact but it was never addressed publicly. There are a few rules that are so small that I can't even think of one anecdotally but my main problem with instances like these is that they are arbitrarily enforced at times and at other times they are completely ignored. And whether or not you are negatively impacted by the enforcement of these rules is determined by who's running the shift, whether or not they like you personally. That kind of sucks.",3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.7122527956962585,0.07318183034658432,0.1714981645345688,0.7130334973335266,0.3073691427707672,0.0008251148392446339,0.4757896959781647,0.3967510461807251,0.12412864714860916,0.4692056179046631,0.9954928159713745,0.00413855817168951,0.045316021889448166,8.435986842414422e-07,0.0007287018815986812,0.00027574115665629506,0.9972146153450012,0.3388797640800476,0.9992825388908386,0.0009139477042481303,0.9957060217857361,0.0043664658442139626,0.03769620880484581,5.727706593461335e-07,0.0006612460128962994,0.000170419632922858,0.0036802077665925026,0.5591581463813782,0.21902622282505035,0.9799104928970337

2097,2019-10, Barista ,"Vancouver, BC",Former Employee ,Don't jump in - evaluate the store and your other opportunities first,"Highly standardized training methodology and curriculum. Excellent opportunities to grow your knowledge from the online portal even as a barista (non corporate employee). Performance expectations are easy to understand. Lots of encouragement to develop your talents. Respectful/friendly store manager, shifts, and team members will make working full time bearable. If you don't have a supportive team, your life will be miserable. Before you start at a particular store, evaluate how much space there is. Avoid a high traffic store if the layout means you will have to walk behind till constantly to handoff warmed food (grilled cheese grease scars people) and pass behind bar - or vice versa. Make sure there enough exit doors if you need to get out due to fire or safety, and where you have to take trash out is generally safe/well-lit. If you can avoid a store with a bathroom, all the better. If you don't have all of these things, seriously consider before working full time. Try to get a sense of what the average tips are for the store you want to work at. Part time or third shift is the safest way to prevent getting worked to the bone.","Pay.your.baristas!!!! Enough of the virtue signaling. A barista working full time (40hrs) per week in Vancouver, BC makes $554 / week (40 hrs x $13.80). The average rent for a 1 bedroom here is $2,208. If you work 160 hrs per month at minimum wage in Vancouver (which is what they will pressure you accept), your gross wages are $2,208/month. Yes, many people take on roommates and don't drive cars to save, but this is simply *not* a livable wage. After 2 months full time, my body was always sore. I had blisters, my joints hurt. My schedule changed every week, and I almost never had 2 days off in row - so I didn't have any time to really unwind. I couldn't commit to plans with friends. We joked that the ""good"" healthcare benefits were really just a way to keep workers functional and showing up for their shifts because of how messed up your body and mind will get from the physical and psychological stress. Almost everyone who'd worked over 1 yr had a wrist support, bad back, soft tissue injury or developed substance abuse/alcoholism. This is the definition of what it means to be a ""wage slave."" Partner discounts and brand recognition do not pay the bills. Starbucks is vehemently anti-union. The Baristas who work at 'branded' stores like Safeway belong to unions. They don't get partner discounts, but you know what? They get paid like human beings. They can negotiate better working conditions and assert their rights, which is a cornerstone of maintaining a basic sense of respect and dignity in oneself.",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.754253625869751,0.7888951897621155,0.27832475304603577,0.31932497024536133,0.3891744911670685,0.013374350033700466,0.31778421998023987,0.4173692762851715,0.33645522594451904,0.1405012458562851,0.995496392250061,0.9782806634902954,0.039489272981882095,8.310199177685718e-07,0.0007974963518790901,0.00021318389917723835,0.004026459064334631,0.14336492121219635,0.12633438408374786,0.0007906875689513981,0.9953030347824097,0.11447549611330032,0.08781887590885162,8.335463235198404e-07,0.0008215795387513936,0.001091731246560812,0.0038051067385822535,0.6246381998062134,0.016556506976485252,0.5707655549049377

2117,2019-10, Barista,"Lake Geneva, WI",Current Employee ,"Good Benefits, Disorienting Labor Environment",Barista duties are mostly fun and easy to learn. Starbucks teaches employees to treat each other well and you will mostly likely grow to like the people you work with. There are reasonable insurance and stock benefits you can earn by working only 20 hours a week.,You will always feel like you could use one more barista working no matter how busy or slow it is day to day. Your schedule may alternate between working in the morning and in the evening which becomes very disorienting for your personal life. Your schedule week to week may be wildly different. It seems the company focuses on limiting labor hours 1000x more than teaching employees to prevent waste.,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.5625920295715332,0.44384196400642395,0.48688602447509766,0.5379942059516907,0.5450259447097778,0.016070881858468056,0.4418598711490631,0.5239657759666443,0.4386459290981293,0.2590560019016266,0.9955441355705261,0.01610623672604561,0.04412657767534256,5.66792948575312e-07,0.20914077758789062,0.0006258395151235163,0.0036847670562565327,0.22160464525222778,0.9989683628082275,0.0007415814907290041,0.9953985810279846,0.026467666029930115,0.0497809462249279,5.729815484301071e-07,0.0016768504865467548,3.946328070014715e-05,0.00405194703489542,0.28847312927246094,0.03684621676802635,0.0021873677615076303

Corporate is often out of touch with partners and sets unreasonable expectations that leads to stress and burnout (e.g. Unicorn Frappuccino, getting rid of the Coffee Master program, Tie-Dye Frappuccino, Happy Hour, etc.)",4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,0.6304315328598022,0.4561498165130615,0.45522233843803406,0.5074858665466309,0.4892776310443878,0.01851949840784073,0.3914403021335602,0.3679969310760498,0.3864530920982361,0.07234631478786469,0.8292660117149353,0.5500721335411072,0.22760500013828278,6.474236579379067e-05,0.5808685421943665,3.437847044551745e-05,0.07712274044752121,0.494212806224823,0.010472302325069904,0.10745614022016525,0.9956156015396118,0.9772638082504272,0.1038307473063469,5.67897245673521e-07,0.0007956881891004741,0.00011962253483943641,0.0035352797713130713,0.3790510892868042,0.05116158723831177,0.02932352013885975

If you’re a young person who lives with your parents and ALSO needs benefits: Starbucks is the place for you. Unfortunately, that pool is very small. You have great healthcare opportunities, stocks, and free coffee every day that you work and a bag to take home every week. Free tuition to attend ASU, and honestly, that can’t be beat by other retailers—but again, it doesn’t appeal to the majority of the workers.","For anyone who DOESN’T live with their parents however... keep looking. They pay minimum wage and overwork the entire team. Even on my best day with my best group of workers we’re still stretched to the breaking point. Starbucks appears to be designed to constantly be understaffed. God forbid one of your partners calls off, and the rest of the staff has a horrific day. More than any retail job I’ve ever had. Pay is stagnant, always about 10 cents above min wage so they can say they treat us better. Many of my 3 year partners are paid the same as the Green Beans. Very much a feeling of us vs them when it comes to the retail workers and upper management. The drink recipes in the last two years have become insanely time-consuming and complicated, but we’ve received no extra labor or money for the changes. Unsure how we’re even going to make it through our holiday season with the turn-over rate we currently have. I’ve lost about 5-6 of my best baristas over an extra dollar in pay somewhere else, or because the stress is too much when you have a line out the door and only two employees scheduled to work. idering it takes about 5-6 months to even learn to do the job well and not be terrified of it, if you won’t use the benefits then don’t bother.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.5801862478256226,0.020601632073521614,0.16033248603343964,0.8443974256515503,0.28588220477104187,7.863448263378814e-05,0.3674983084201813,0.37948301434516907,0.1092514619231224,0.640602707862854,0.9952061772346497,0.05575589835643768,0.050584886223077774,5.717081421607872e-07,0.9843429327011108,0.00021364499116316438,0.0039077382534742355,0.3050568103790283,0.04147332161664963,0.0013386982027441263,0.9952850937843323,0.02123865857720375,0.04666806012392044,6.314782012850628e-07,0.0008518727263435721,0.0009101653704419732,0.00391976535320282,0.214520663022995,0.4315156042575836,0.1098121926188469
