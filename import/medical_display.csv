<h1>Introduction</h1>
Specialized online platforms are increasingly used to discuss and rate workplace experiences. For workplace reviews of the S&P 500 companies, you can visualize and compare aggregate reviews across companies, years, and job types. You can zoom into specific periods of time, change company, and download all the resulting plots in png format.</br></br>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
A new AI tool  (called <a href=""https://social-dynamics.net/MedDL"">MedDL</a>) is able to extract medical conditions from textual reviews. MedDL is based on state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and contextual embeddings (RoBERTa). For, say, a given time period, the visualization shows the fraction of the total number of posts (per thousands) that mentioned workplace stress, anxiety, and flu. These conditions are either common (stress) or interesting yet hard to capture in a workplace context (i.e., flu and PTSD). The visualization's vertical bars are  events related to the selected company.

Mentions does not entirely mean that employees are experiencing stress or PTSD but could also mean that empolyees are simply talking about it (e.g., talking about a fund the company dedicated to war veterans suffering from PTSD). Also, mentions related to an event might come before the event becomes public or might reflect its long-lasting effects well after its announcement.
