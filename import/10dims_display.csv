<h1>Introduction</h1>
Specialized online platforms are increasingly used to discuss and rate the workplace experiences. In this project, we mined reviews from one such a platform for the S&P 500 companies in the U.S. The visualization displays different patterns in reviews across companies, employee role types, and time.</br></br>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
The project uses the 10 dimensions of conversations and relationships <a href=""https://social-dynamics.net/10dimensions/"">10dim</a>, a previously published method that extracts 10 distinct types of interaction extensively discussed in psychology that are found account for the way most people conceptualize their relationships. These types are:
 The method analysed 440K company reviews posted during the past 7 years by the employees in the U.S. and extracted various mentions of workplace stress, anxiety, and flu. The visualization presents the fraction (in per cents) of total posts expressing each of these the 10 dimensions across different breakdowns, i.e., time, companies, and employee roles.</br></br>
The thickness of the graph lines corresponds to the number of reviews for the company/role for that period. The vertical bars represent relevant events to the company. You can hover over them to find out more information.</br></br>
When interpreting the graphs, it is important to have in mind that the reviews might be lagging behind the actual events that could have influenced them.
